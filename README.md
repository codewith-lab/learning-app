User Interface Design Final project

In order for this to run you need to install the requirements. This can simply be done by running 

"pip install -r requirements.txt" in the root folder. However I believe with new Mac Os updates you might have to do that thru a virtual environment. See below! 

Run the following commands in sequential order.

Create virtual environment:
python -m venv env

Activate virtual env:
source env/bin/activate

Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

After that, running server.py will run the program on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (the ending port may differ depending on what ports you have available)
